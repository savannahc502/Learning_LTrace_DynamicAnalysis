# Learning_LTrace_DynamicAnalysis
As a part of Champlain College's FOR-350-01 (Malware Analysis &amp; Incident Response) course, I was tasked with analyzing sample malware in order to learn some basics on performing dynamic analysis on Linux.

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/savannahc502/Learning_LTrace_DynamicAnalysis/wiki) for notes related to the lab setup and deliverables.
